# Labitat Bylaws

## What?

These are the bylaws and other official documents of [Labitat](https://labitat.dk/) the hackerspace in Copenhagen.

## Why?

This repository exists as the official source of these documents so that we can make pull requests and review any changes.
The different documents have different rules for when and how they can be changed, but this repository provides an easier way to talk about and edit sets of changes (as pull request).

## Changes

[Bylaws / Vedt√¶gter](bylaws.md): Can only be changed after a sucessful vote at a general assembly.

[Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md): Can be changed by a unanimous vote by the board and needs to be ratified at the next general assembly.
In practice this means our biweekly meetings needs to approve them first.
