## Labitat Code of Conduct

We are committed to making Labitat an inclusive
and welcoming space for everyone at all times.
The most important rule is to be excellent to each other.

Sadly, technology communities have a notorious reputation for harassment.
We've set these ground rules to clarify that this behaviour is unacceptable
so everyone can feel comfortable being part of Labitat.

Everyone who visits Labitat must abide by this code of conduct,
both in the physical space and in any space that utilizes Labitat’s brand,
e.g., in camps, festivals, etc., and on any online channels.

Members who do not pay the minimum amount to become paying members in Labitat
have access to Labitat when others let them in.
See [Wiki (TODO)][] for the minimum donation amount to Labitat.
Paying members have access to the Labitat door every day via a personal code.
Sharing your personal code or using someone else's is a violation
of the code of conduct.

Machines that require training must only be used after an introduction from
a super user of that machine, even if you have used a similar machine before.
See the wiki with a [list of super users][who].

Remember that as a member of Labitat, you are responsible for cleaning up after
yourself and helping others do the same.
Leave Labitat in better shape than you found it.

Labitat will not tolerate harassment of participants or discriminatory,
narcissistic, interpersonal, mental, or physically violent behaviour of any
form.
Specifically:

* Do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist,
  or otherwise prejudiced behaviour.

* Do not harass people. Stalking, unconsented unwanted physical contact,
  or unconsented, unwanted sexual attention, physical violence, narcissistic
  behaviour, or mental violence.

* Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent.

* Labitat is a shared space, but every participant's personal space is theirs.
  If you are asked to leave someone alone, you must respect this.

* Some members may not want to be filmed or photographed.
  Respect their wishes and always ask before you use a camera.

* Aggression and elitism are unwelcome;
  nobody should be afraid to ask questions.

Remember that assholes can only remain assholes if their entourage enables it
by not saying no to their behaviour.
Therefore, if you have questions on how to handle a conflict about Labitat or
if you are in doubt if something is a violation of the code of conduct policy,

We expect everyone to treat the space, bunkers, garden, tools,
and infrastructure with the utmost care and respect.
We will not tolerate any kind of vandalism, including littering.

We may expel you or issue a time-out if you break these rules.
The board makes the decision.
Labitat may facilitate that the person harmed is to contact the police in
connection with offenses, e.g., physical or mental violence or harassment etc.
