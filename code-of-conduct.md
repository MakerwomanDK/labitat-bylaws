## Labitat Code of Conduct

We are committed to making Labitat an inclusive
and welcoming space for everyone.
The most important rule is: Be excellent to each other.

Sadly, technology communities have a notorious reputation for harassment.
We've set these ground rules to make it abundantly clear that this kind of
behaviour is not acceptable, so everyone can feel comfortable being part of
Labitat.

Everyone who visits Labitat is required to abide by this code of conduct,
both in the physical space and on any online channels.
We will not tolerate harassment of participants or discriminatory behaviour of
any form.
Specifically:

* Do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist,
  or otherwise prejudiced behaviour.
* Do not harass people.
  Stalking, unconsented physical contact, or unwanted sexual attention
  is harassment.
  Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent.

* Labitat is a shared space, but every participant's personal space
  is their own.
  If you are asked to leave someone alone, you must respect this.

* Some members may not want to be filmed or photographed.
  Respect their wishes and always ask before you use a camera.

* Aggression and elitism are not welcome
  â€” nobody should be afraid to ask questions.

We expect everyone to treat the space, bunkers and garden as well as tools
and infrastructure with the utmost care and respect.
We will not tolerate any kind of vandalism, this includes littering.

If you break these rules, we may expel you or issue a time-out.
The decision is made by the board and can be tried at the annual general
meeting.

If you are being harassed or witness a breach of this code of conduct,
you can drop us an email at `conduct <at> labitat.dk`.

If you prefer to speak to a female you can write to Kirsten at
`makerwoman <at> labitat.dk`.

If you have any comments or queries, you can get in touch with the board at
`bestyrelse <at> labitat.dk`.
